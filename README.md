*"Buy less, choose well, make it last." - Vivienne Westwood*

Imagine this: in the Bay Area alone, where seven million people live, we generate over 490 million pounds of textile waste every year. That's a staggering number. But it’s not just about the waste: it’s about the opportunity. At Conscious Closet, we challenged ourselves to think differently about waste. This isn't just about reducing environmental harm; it's about creating a system that promotes social responsibility and conserves our precious resources. 

By promoting upcycling and recycling, this app helps decrease the demand for dye-ing and treatment processes that release toxic chemicals, as well as reducing the need for fast fashion production, which subsequently lowers water consumption traditionally used in textile manufacturing.

## Our Solution

Conscious Closet utilizes AI-powered technology to transform wardrobe management and promote sustainable fashion. Through features like image recognition, weather forecasting, and user-preference analytics, the app empowers users to make informed choices about their clothing, whether it's wearing, upcycling, donating, or recycling. This not only reduces textile waste and carbon footprint but also encourages ethical consumer behavior by supporting sustainable brands. By combating fast fashion, Conscious Closet fosters responsible consumption and environmental stewardship among individuals.

Our web app's features currently include: 
- An AI-powered outfit planner that generates suggestions on outfits based on the user's location and correlating weather
- A constantly refreshing list of tips on upcycling for the users to prioritize responsible sustainability
- A fully interactive map of the area surrounding the user, with markers pointing to the nearest thrift stores where they may purchase or donate clothes
- An accurate AI-powered image detection tool that detects user-submitted images of their clothing in order to match them with suggestions online
